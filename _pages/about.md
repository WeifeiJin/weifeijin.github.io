I am an undergraduate student majoring in Cyberspace Security (Experimental Class) at 
**Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)**, advised by [Prof. Jie Hao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z26c40QAAAAJ).
Currently, I am a Research Intern at **Duke University**, advised by [Prof. Neil Gong](https://people.duke.edu/~zg70/). 
Starting in February 2026, I will join **ByteDance** as an AI Security Research Intern (Flow Team) to work on LLM and Agent security.
Previously, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ke Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_XXLtZgAAAAJ) at **Tsinghua University**. 
I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Yuxin Cao](https://yuxincao22.github.io/) (from National University of Singapore).

Research Interests
======
My research vision is to build **secure, trustworthy, and robust AI systems** capable of interacting with the physical world. I systematically address vulnerabilities across the AI's expanding capability stack:

* **Perception ("The Ears"):** Defending against input-level manipulation in multimodal perception, exploring modal-agnostic adversarial robustness beyond just the audio domain.
* **Cognition ("The Brain"):** Mitigating model-level exploits and ensuring safety alignment in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and autonomous AI Agents.
* **Memory ("The Knowledge"):** Protecting Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and external knowledge bases from context-level injection and poisoning.
