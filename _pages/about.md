I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Cyberspace Security** at 
[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).
My research interests lie in **Trustworthy AI**, **Adversarial Machine Learning**, and **Speech Security**.
I have been working under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Hao](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/3808.htm) in the [National Engineering Research Center of Disaster Backup and Recovery](http://www.zaibei.org.cn/).
I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Yuxin Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GCYqueEAAAAJ) (from [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/)) and [Dr. Derui Wang](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=uAbiaaUAAAAJ) (from [CSIRO's Data61](https://www.csiro.au/en/research/technology-space?start=0&count=12)).

If you would like to learn more about my work, feel free to check out my recent publications below or contact me directly.
