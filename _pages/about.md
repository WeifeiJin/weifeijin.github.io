I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Cyberspace Security (Experimental Class) at 
[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT)](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/).
My research interests lie in **Trustworthy AI**, **Adversarial Machine Learning**, and **Speech Security**.
I have been working under the supervision of [Prof. Jie Hao](https://scss.bupt.edu.cn/info/1063/3808.htm) in the [National Engineering Research Center of Disaster Backup and Recovery](http://www.zaibei.org.cn/).
I also collaborate closely with [Dr. Yuxin Cao](https://yuxincao22.github.io/) (from [NUS](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/)).
